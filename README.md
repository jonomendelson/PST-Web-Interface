# Phase Stretch Transform Web Interface
Web interface for the Phase Stretch Transform edge detection algorithm  (https://github.com/JalaliLabUCLA/Image-feature-detection-using-Phase-Stretch-Transform) created using a LAMP stack, AJAX, Python that allows users to upload custom images, interact in real time with the Photonics Laboratory’s edge detection algorithm by modifying the algorithm’s parameters, and save or share their creations.
